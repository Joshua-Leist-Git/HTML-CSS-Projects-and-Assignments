<h2 class="gold-heading">Preparation</h2>

<p>Enclosed is a handbook that will help get you up to speed in preparation for your training. In your application, you had asked about my favorite Starbucks coffee roasts. To answer your question, here is a list of my favorite three roasts with descriptions.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Pike Place Roast</dt>
  <dd>From our first store in Seattle’s Pike Place Market to our coffeehouses around the world, customers requested a freshly brewed coffee they could enjoy throughout the day. So in 2008 our master blenders and roasters created it for you, a blend so consistent and harmonious that no single characteristic dominates—or disappears. A smooth, well-rounded blend of Latin American coffees with subtly rich flavors of cocoa and toasted nuts, it’s perfect for every day.</dd>

  <dt>Sumatra</dt>
  <dd>Like the lush Indonesian island of its origin, this spicy coffee stands alone. Full-bodied with a smooth mouthfeel, lingering flavors of dried herbs and fresh earth, and almost no acidity. Our roasters love transforming these unpredictable beans from dark coral green to tiger-orange to a rich, oily mahogany, revealing bold flavors that many of us can’t live without. Coffee from Sumatra is the foundation of our most treasured blends, and something we’ve been honored to share with you for four decades.</dd>

  <dt>Italian Roast
  <dt>
  <dd>This is Starbucks quintessential dark roast—expertly crafted to bring out sweetness and intensity. It showcases the precision and skill of our roasters, who created a coffee that's slightly darker than our Espresso Roast without the smoky edge of French Roast. A great cup of coffee, it has a depth of flavor that holds its own with cream and sugar.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Welcome to Starbucks! We are excited for you to join the team and are looking forward to working with you for years to come.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
  Howard Shultz</p>
